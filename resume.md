## 💻 TECHNICAL PROJECTS

**Restaurant OS: Event-Driven ETL Microservice (Proj 7)** | `FastAPI` `PostgreSQL` `Webhooks`
* Architected a high-speed FastAPI microservice to ingest asynchronous JSON payloads from fragmented SaaS silos (Toast POS & 7shifts).
* Implemented **FastAPI BackgroundTasks** to compute real-time KPIs (CPLH, Contribution Margins) without blocking upstream API services.
* Engineered **idempotent UPSERT logic** in a PostgreSQL (Supabase) environment to ensure 100% data integrity during out-of-order data events.

**Cloud-Native Report Engine (Proj 6)** | `Python` `Jinja2` `WeasyPrint`
* Designed a decoupled backend pipeline that processes raw payloads through a custom mathematical diagnostic rules engine.
* Automated high-fidelity, branded PDF generation using WeasyPrint and a memory-efficient "No-Disk" ingestion layer.
* Secured all cloud persistence layers and API endpoints using professional `.env` masking and version control protocols.

**WordPress REST API Data Pipeline (Proj 5)** | `Python` `WordPress API`
* Developed a production-grade ETL pipeline bridging raw data scraping with structured CMS ingestion via direct REST API mapping.
* Implemented deterministic MD5 hashing to create unique data fingerprints, ensuring complete idempotency during high-volume reruns.

**Enterprise Data Acquisition & IoT Suite (Proj 1–4)** | `LoRa` `ESP32` `Playwright` `Pandas`
* **Smart Park:** Engineered a dual-sensor fusion system using Magnetometers and Ultrasonic sensors on ESP32 nodes to detect vehicle occupancy using hardware-level "AND" logic.
* **Hybrid API Extractor (SchoolSpring):** Built a pipeline to bypass enterprise WAFs (Incapsula) by bridging browser sessions to high-speed API requests.
* **CDP Session Interceptor (Shopee):** Utilized Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) to hijack live sessions and bypass anti-bot detections for high-fidelity market intelligence.
* **PDF Intelligence Pipeline:** Built an ETL layer to automate unstructured data extraction from procurement portals into relational SQLite databases.

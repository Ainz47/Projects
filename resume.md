## 💻 TECHNICAL PROJECTS

### Restaurant OS: Event-Driven ETL Microservice (Proj 7) | [cite_start]`FastAPI` `PostgreSQL` `Webhooks` [cite: 58]
* [cite_start]Architected a high-speed FastAPI microservice to ingest asynchronous JSON payloads from fragmented SaaS silos (Toast POS & 7shifts)[cite: 59].
* [cite_start]Implemented **FastAPI BackgroundTasks** to compute real-time KPIs (CPLH, Contribution Margins) without blocking upstream API services[cite: 60].
* [cite_start]Engineered **idempotent UPSERT logic** in a PostgreSQL (Supabase) environment to ensure 100% data integrity during out-of-order data events[cite: 61].

### Cloud-Native Report Engine (Proj 6) | [cite_start]`Python` `Jinja2` `WeasyPrint` [cite: 62]
* [cite_start]Designed a decoupled backend pipeline that processes raw payloads through a custom mathematical diagnostic rules engine[cite: 63].
* [cite_start]Automated high-fidelity, branded PDF generation using WeasyPrint and a memory-efficient "No-Disk" ingestion layer[cite: 64].

### WordPress REST API Data Pipeline (Proj 5) | [cite_start]`Python` `WordPress API` [cite: 65]
* [cite_start]Developed a production-grade ETL pipeline bridging raw data scraping with structured CMS ingestion via direct REST API mapping[cite: 66].
* [cite_start]Implemented deterministic MD5 hashing to create unique data fingerprints, ensuring complete idempotency during high-volume reruns[cite: 67].

### Enterprise Data Acquisition & IoT Suite (Proj 1–4) | [cite_start]`LoRa` `ESP32` `Playwright` `Pandas` [cite: 68]
* [cite_start]**Smart Park:** Engineered a dual-sensor fusion system using Magnetometers and Ultrasonic sensors on ESP32 nodes to detect vehicle occupancy with "AND" logic[cite: 69].
* [cite_start]**LoRa-to-Cloud Gateway:** Developed a centralized receiver gateway to transmit real-time sensor data via LoRa to the Blynk IoT Cloud for live monitoring[cite: 70].
* [cite_start]**Hybrid API Extractor:** Built a pipeline to bypass enterprise WAFs (Incapsula) by bridging browser sessions to high-speed API requests[cite: 71].
* [cite_start]**CDP Session Interceptor:** Utilized Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) to hijack live sessions and bypass anti-bot detections for high-fidelity market intelligence[cite: 72].

# Hi, I'm Jhurald 👋
### Full-Stack Data Engineer | Systems Architect

Welcome to my project repository. I am an Electronics Engineering student at USeP specializing in **decoupled backend architecture**, **event-driven ETL pipelines**, and **hardware-to-cloud IoT systems**.

## 🏗️ Featured Architecture
These core systems demonstrate my ability to build secure, idempotent pipelines and complex business logic:

* **[Proj 7] Restaurant OS ETL:** Event-driven FastAPI microservice handling asynchronous JSON payloads with PostgreSQL idempotent UPSERTs.
* **[Proj 6] Cloud-Native Report Engine:** Decoupled backend pipeline using Jinja2/WeasyPrint for automated, data-driven PDF generation.
* **[IoT] Smart Park System:** Dual-sensor fusion (Magnetometer + Ultrasonic) on ESP32 nodes with LoRa-to-Cloud telemetry.

## 🕷️ Data Acquisition & Automation Suite
A collection of high-performance extraction tools built to bypass modern web defenses:
* **Hybrid API Extractors:** Bridging Playwright browser sessions to high-speed backend API requests (Incapsula/Cloudflare bypass).
* **CDP Session Interceptors:** Hijacking live browser sessions via Chrome DevTools Protocol to capture hidden high-fidelity market data.
* **PDF Intelligence Pipelines:** Automated unstructured data extraction into relational SQLite databases.

Session Bridging: Playwright + Requests API Scraper
A high-performance Data Engineering pipeline designed to bypass enterprise-grade Web Application Firewalls (WAF) by bridging browser-based session authentication with low-overhead HTTP requests.

🏗️ Architecture Overview
Most modern Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) like SchoolSpring/PowerSchool utilize security layers (e.g., Incapsula/Imperva) that block standard headless scrapers.

This project implements a Hybrid Extraction Strategy:

Session Initiation (The Handshake): Uses Playwright to launch a headless Chromium instance, navigating the front-end to solve the WAF challenge and generate valid security cookies.

State Transfer (The Bridge): Programmatically extracts the raw_cookies from the Playwright browser context and maps them into a Python dictionary.

High-Speed Ingestion (The Extraction): Injects the "stolen" cookies into a Requests session to hit the backend API directly. This bypasses the need to render DOM elements, allowing for near-instantaneous data retrieval of 1,000+ records in a single network call.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Automation: Playwright (Chromium)

Networking: Requests (Session-based)

Data Processing: Pandas

Target: SchoolSpring/PowerSchool API (GetPagedJobsWithSearch)

🚀 Key Engineering Features
WAF Persistence: Successfully navigates the Incapsula firewall that typically triggers 403 Forbidden errors for standard bots.

API Reverse-Engineering: Instead of "scraping" HTML elements, this script targets the JSON backend directly via the size=1000 parameter hack, drastically reducing bandwidth and execution time.

Headless-First: Optimized to run in a Linux/CI environment (GitHub Actions ready).

Data Normalization: Automatically converts the nested JSON API response into a flattened CSV for immediate business analysis.

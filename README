# 🏫 School District ATS Data Extractor (API)

## Overview
This project is an automated Python data ingestion pipeline designed to extract job openings from school districts. 

Instead of building a fragile web scraper that breaks when a school updates its website HTML, this script **reverse-engineers the internal API** of the Applicant Tracking System (SchoolSpring). By hitting the backend endpoints directly, it extracts raw, perfectly structured JSON data.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **100% Data Accuracy:** Bypassing the UI ensures no missing fields or formatting errors.
* **Immunity to UI Changes:** The pipeline remains stable even if the target website undergoes a complete redesign.
* **Clean Output:** Converts nested JSON structures into flat, client-ready CSV spreadsheets using Pandas.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** `requests` (API extraction), `pandas` (Data transformation and CSV loading)

## 📄 Sample Output
Included in this repository is `tcisd_ultimate_api_jobs.csv`, demonstrating the clean, structured data output generated by this pipeline.
